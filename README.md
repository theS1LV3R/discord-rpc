# Discord RPC

> A small program to have a custom status in discord using Discord RPC

This project uses [Discord RPC](https://github.com/discordjs/rpc) to connect
and interface with the discord client, and generate a custom status. This way
you can have buttons and images as well as the normal default text.

## Installation and usage

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

_more to come when I remember to add it_
